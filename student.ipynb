    "### Business Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tanzania is one of the countries located in East Africa and has a population of over 67 million. The country has a diverse geography that includes Mount Kilimanjaro, the Serengeti, and lakes Victoria and Tanganyika. Its home to over 120 ethnic groups and uses Swahili and English as official languages. Most people live in rural areas, and the population is largely young. Politically, it is a stable presidential republic led by the long-ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party. The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, and mining. However, Tanzania faces key development challenges, including poverty, youth unemployment, and regional disparities. A critical concern is limited access to clean water, especially in rural areas where water sources are scarce or polluted. This impacts health, agriculture, and education, particularly for women and children who collect water daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this context, the Government of Tanzania in collboration with sector stakeholders through the Ministry of Water and Irrigation is in progress implementing its 20-Year (2006-2025) Water Sector Development Programme (WSDP) alongside the Tanzania Development Vision 2025 which aspires to achieve universal access to water supply in urban areas and ensuring 90% water supply coverage in rural areas by 2025. The Vision also aspires to ensure that water resources are available in a sustainable manner to serve as a driver to social and economic needs. This goal aligns and contributes to the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 6, that aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. In Tanzania, the current average water supply coverage in urban and rural areas is 78% and 59.76%, respectively. The major water sources include Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, rivers like the Rufiji, underground aquifers, and wells both shallow and deep. However, access is challenged by seasonal variability, pollution, overuse, and inadequate infrastructure. In rural areas, many depend on wells, which often face issues like contamination, drying, and poor maintenance."

    "### Problem Statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Tanzania, a larger proportion of its citizenry relies of water wells as key source of water. Such sources are prone to contamination, drying, and poor maintenance. Therefore, it requires monitoring for water levels, quality and even maintenance. The Tanzanian water wells dataset provides a comprehensive information for approximately over 59,000 water wells with necessary features providing information related to pump, installation, location and condition related.  As government in collaboration with sector stakeholders (NGOs, private actors) put measures to achieve universal access to water supply in urban areas and ensuring 90% water supply coverage in rural areas by 2025. It is prudent to identify where to invest scarce resources and achieve optimal impact utilizing the available information. The task at hand involves finding a scientific approach that can provide information on which waterpoints will likely fail and thus better plan accordingly for operational maintenance.\n",
    "Therefore, as a data scientist, we hope to solve this problem by developing a predictive model that can be used to determine which water pumps are faulty to promote access to clean, potable water across Tanzania"
